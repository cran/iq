\title{
The MaxLFQ algorithm for protein quantification
}
\description{
Estimates protein abundances by aiming to maintain the fragment intensity ratios between samples.
}
\usage{
maxLFQ(X)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{A matrix of ion intensities in log2 space. Columns are samples and rows are fragment ions.}
}
\value{
A list of two components is returned
\item{estimate}{A vector with length equal to the number of columns of the input containing the protein abundances.}
\item{annotation}{An empty string if all quantified samples are connected. Otherwise, a string of membership of the connected components is returned.}
